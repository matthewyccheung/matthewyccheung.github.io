<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Iterative subspace projection methods are used for solving large sparse
linear systems (i.e. Ax = b). We implement the Steepest Descent (SD),
Conjugate Gradient (CG), Minimal Residual (RM) and Restarted GMRES
algorithms to study the convergence behaviors of these methods for the
matrices bcsstk15, mahindas, nos3 and west0479 from The University of
Florida Sparse Matrix Collection. The matrices are shown below.</p>

<p>The investigated parameters in this report will be the residuals and the
eigenvalues.</p>

<p>In this section, functions for each of the methods were written using
MATLAB. A pseudo code implementation will be presented in the main
report and the code will be provided in the appendix. These will be
verified using the built in methods (i.e. gmres, cg). Then the
implementations will be run on the test matrices.</p>

<p>A is SPD only when $r_k &gt; 0$. When $r_k = 0$, the algorithm has

iteration. The Krylov subspaces are generated and orthogonalized using
the Arnoldi Iteration. This can be represented by the equations

<h2 id="part-ii-iterative-subspace-projection-methods-for-large-scale-eigenvalue-problems">Part II: Iterative subspace projection methods for large scale eigenvalue problems</h2>

<p>In this part, the Arnoldi method with and without reorthogonalization
are used to to compute eigenpairs of large sparse matrix A (west0479)
for different iterations. This was compared to the “exact” eigenvalues
computed using the eig function in MATLAB. The real and imaginary values
are plotted and discussed.</p>

<h3 id="reorthogonalizationno-reorthogonalization-and-residual-comparison">Reorthogonalization/No Reorthogonalization and Residual Comparison</h3>

<p>The Arnoldi (with Reorthogonalization) code is modified so that he
reorthogonalization is not done. The correctness of the code is verified
using <script type="math/tex">|| AV_m - V_{m+1}\hat{H}_m ||_2</script> 
The orthogonality is evaluated using the residual <script type="math/tex">||I - V^H_{j+1}V_{j+1}||_2</script></p>

<h3 id="ritz-values">Ritz Values</h3>

<p>A method to attain eigenvalues is to use the eigenvalues of the
Hessenberg matrix $H_j$. These are computed using the eig command. The
Ritz values and the exact eigenvalues together. In theory, the outlying
eigenvalues are good approximations for the Ritz values.</p>

<h3 id="arnoldi-with-shift-and-inversion">Arnoldi with Shift and Inversion</h3>

<p>The shift and invert spectral transform are used to find the eigenvalues
closest to a target. Instead of multiplying the initial vector by A, the
vector is multiplied by $(A - \tau I)^{-1}$, where $\tau$ is the target.
This is similar to the power method with shift and inversion. The
eigenvalues problem now becomes
<script type="math/tex">(A - \tau I)^{-1}x = \frac{1}{\lambda - \sigma}x</script></p>

<p>The eigenvalue ($\lambda_j$) closest to $\tau$ of the shifted and
inverted problem $\sigma = \frac{1}{\lambda_j - \tau}$ is now dominant
and thus leads to a smaller residual. The residuals can be proved to be
[3]
<script type="math/tex">||r_j|| \leq h_{m+1,m} |\lambda_j - \tau|\;||A-\tau b||\; |e^T_my_j|</script></p>

<p>From this form, we see that the residual ($r_j$) is bounded by zero if
$\lambda$ is a good estimate for $\tau$.</p>

seen by taking the determinant of mahindas, which is computed to be
-1.0008e-20.</p>

<h3 id="reorthogonalizationno-reorthogonalization-and-residual-comparison-1">Reorthogonalization/No Reorthogonalization and Residual Comparison</h3>

<p>To check my correctness of the Reorthogonalized Arnoldi Algorithm,
<script type="math/tex">|| AV_m - V_{m+1}\hat{H}_m ||_2</script> was computed for 30 iterations to be
2.6297e-12. Similarly, for the Arnoldi without reorthogonalization,
<script type="math/tex">|| AV_m - V_{m+1}\hat{H}_m ||_2</script> was computed to be 2.2025e-12. Both of
these are approximately zero, despite being 4 orders of magnitude
smaller than machine precision.</p>

<p>The orthogonality was evaluated using the residual
<script type="math/tex">||I - V^H_{j+1}V_{j+1}||_2</script>. At 30 iterations, these were computed to
be 1.1814e-15 for the Reorthogonalized Arnoldi Algorithm and 4.3886e-13
for the Non-Reorthogonalized Algorithm. Also, at 60 iterations, the
Non-Reorthogonalized Algorithm residual the residual
<script type="math/tex">||I - V^H_{j+1}V_{j+1}||_2</script> was 8.9316e-12. From these results, it is
evident that $V_{j+1}$ loses orthogonality. Therefore, in practice, it
is a good idea to implement the reorthogonalization. Furthermore, the
residuals were computed to be 2.2025e-12 and 7.0673e-11 for 30 and 60
iterations.</p>

<h3 id="ritz-values-1">Ritz Values</h3>

<p>The Ritz values were computed using the eig command and compared to the
exact eigenvalues.</p>

<p><img src="pics/ritz10.png" alt="Hessenberg vs Exact Eigenvalues for iterations =

<p><img src="pics/ritz20.png" alt="Hessenberg vs Exact Eigenvalues for iterations =

<p><img src="pics/ritz30.png" alt="Hessenberg vs Exact Eigenvalues for iterations =
30[]{label=&quot;datagen&quot;}" /></p>

<p>From the figures above, the eigenvalues are approximated well by the
Ritz values. However, the number of iterations does not improve the
eigenvalue approximations. The norm of the difference between the
Reorthogonalized and the Non-Reorthogonalized eigenvalues were computed
to be 528.5324 and 275.3189 for both algorithms. The shift-inversion
spectral transformation converges to the dominant eigenvalue. The
implementation was unsuccessful and did not yield good results.</p>
