I'm a PhD student in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at Rice University. Broadly speaking, I'm interested solving real-world problems using fundamentals of Computational Imaging, DSP and Machine Learning. In the past, I have done some work on end-to-end optimization design of all-optical systems for simultaneous imaging and parallel processing (Deep Diffractive Neural Networks) and have studied topics related to Computational Science & Engineering.
